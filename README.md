# Dashboards
Here I place my dashboards of all kinds : some made for fun little projects, others made for work or during training.

Without further ado, let's start with the first one "AniDashboard".

AniDashboard : Fun little project that I decided to make on my own, as a little side quest for my anime recommendation project with generative AI (more on that later when I'll make the repository for it). Challenged myself to make it in less than 9 hours, took me 5 (Had to get back to Dax which was an easy task, but with the dataset that I had this wasn't lol).

Frankly there was no goal in mind except exploring the dataset and doing a dashboard, plus getting few arguments to prove my points during debates with the boys mostly.

It's an interactive dashboard of course.

First Page : 

The first page presents an overview of the number of anime available in the database, categorized by genre, studio, and content type. 

Total Anime: The indicator at the top displays the total number of anime in the database.
Distribution by Genres: A pie chart shows the distribution of anime by genre, making it easy to identify the most popular ones.
Content Types: A breakdown by type (TV, OVA, Movie, ONA, Special, etc.) is also visible, showing the most produced media types.
Top Anime by Studio and Scores: The chart displays the highest-rated anime by studio, with details such as release date and rating, easier to spot iconic productions by studio.
Genres vs. Number of Members: A bar graph shows the total number of anime by genre and studio, providing insight into the distribution in the genre.

Second Page :

This page is dedicated to production studios and licensees, providing an overview of the major players in the industry.

Top 10 Most Productive Studios: A bar graph highlights the studios that have produced the most anime, allowing you to visualize the industry heavyweights (like Toei Animation and Sunrise).
Top 10 Licensors: A pie chart shows the major anime licensees, highlighting those that hold the most distribution rights (like Funimation and Sentai Filmworks).
Favorite Anime Over the Years: This line graph shows the most popular anime, year by year, as voted by users. This helps track popularity trends over time and identify notable productions.
Average Episode Length Evolution: A scatter plot shows the evolution of average episode length by studio over the decades, illustrating how anime production has evolved in terms of episode length to remain at the 23-minute limit for almost 20 years now.

Third and last page : 

This page focuses on the popularity of anime genres, age groups, and fan engagement within communities.

Distribution by Source of Material: A pie chart shows where anime originated (manga, light novel, original, etc.), highlighting the industry's heavy reliance on manga.
Top Fanbases in 2023: A donut chart shows the largest anime communities, based on number of members. It features fanbases of popular franchises like Shingeki no Kyojin, Death Note, and Naruto, illustrating their importance in the industry.
